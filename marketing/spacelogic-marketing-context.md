## Company Overview

### What We Do

SpaceLogic is an AI-powered workplace strategy platform that helps boutique commercial real estate brokers compete with enterprise firms like JLL, CBRE, and Deloitte - without the enterprise overhead.

We transform the 10-20 hour manual office space planning process into a 30-minute AI-assisted workflow, enabling independent brokers to deliver enterprise-quality proposals and win more mid-market deals.

### Mission

Empower independent commercial real estate brokers to compete and win against big firms by giving them access to sophisticated AI-powered workplace strategy tools at affordable pricing.

### The Problem We Solve

Boutique CRE brokers (1-10 person firms) face an unfair fight:

**Their Reality:**
- Compete against JLL/CBRE/Deloitte for mid-market clients ($100K-$2M lease deals)
- Clients expect professional presentations and sophisticated financial analysis
- Currently use Excel to manually build scenarios (10-20 hours per client)
- Excel printouts make them look small-time compared to enterprise competitors
- Can't afford internal tools, workplace strategists, or junior analysts
- Lose deals to big firms who can respond faster with better-looking proposals

**What They Need:**
- Tools that make them look as sophisticated as enterprise firms
- Speed to beat JLL to the first proposal
- Professional branded outputs that wow clients
- AI-powered insights that position them as strategic advisors
- Affordable pricing ($150-300/month range, not $50K enterprise contracts)

### The Solution

SpaceLogic gives boutique brokers enterprise-level capabilities:

**Core Features:**
- Natural language AI scenario builder (describe client needs, get 3 instant scenarios)
- Side-by-side scenario comparison (traditional, moderate, progressive)
- Kit of parts breakdown (office count, desk count, conference rooms, etc.)
- Multi-year financial modeling (5, 10, 15, 20 year projections with escalations)
- TI construction cost estimates (Class D estimates for planning)
- Professional branded exports (PDF, Word, Excel)
- Market rent data for major North American metros

**The Transformation:**
- **Before:** 10-20 hours in Excel → Email proposal → Wait for response → Revisions → Decision (1-2 weeks)
- **After:** 30 minutes with client → AI generates scenarios → Explore together → Export proposal → Decision (same meeting)

## Positioning vs. Competitors

### Competitive Landscape

**Primary Competitors to Position Against:**

**Enterprise Workplace Consultants (Deloitte, JLL Consulting, CBRE Workplace Strategy)**
- **Their strength:** Deep expertise, bespoke analysis, established credibility
- **Their weakness:** $300-500/hour billing, slow (weeks for proposals), inaccessible to SMB clients
- **Our position:** "Enterprise-level analysis in 30 minutes, not 3 weeks. At 1/100th the cost."

**CBRE Spacer (Free Tool)**
- **Their strength:** Free, CBRE brand, simple UX
- **Their weakness:** No financial modeling, no AI, no scenario comparison, no local market data
- **Our position:** "We do what Spacer does PLUS multi-year financial modeling, AI scenarios, and local market data."

**Manual Excel Process**
- **Their strength:** Free, complete control, familiar
- **Their weakness:** Slow (10-20 hours), unprofessional outputs, error-prone, doesn't scale
- **Our position:** "Professional proposals in 1/20th the time. Look like JLL, not like Excel."

**ChatGPT**
- **Their strength:** Free/cheap, general AI capabilities, familiar interface
- **Their weakness:** Not purpose-built for CRE, no financial modeling, no market data, no professional exports
- **Our position:** "Purpose-built for CRE with real market data and professional outputs, not generic AI responses."

- PDF exports that make you look like you have a design team

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Philosophy

Price as high as the market will bear while remaining dramatically cheaper than enterprise alternatives and delivering clear ROI on first deal won.

### Recommended Pricing Structure

**FREE TIER:**
- Single scenario only
- Basic space calculation (competitive with CBRE Spacer)
- Generic national cost averages
- Watermarked PDF exports
- 2 projects/month limit
- **Purpose:** Capture users, demonstrate value, compete with free tools

**PROFESSIONAL: $299/month** (Recommended starting point)
- Unlimited scenarios with side-by-side comparison
- Local market rent data for major metros
- Full financial modeling (5-10-15-20 year projections)
- TI allowance and construction cost modeling
- Custom branded exports (PDF, Word, Excel)
- Unlimited client projects
- AI-powered scenario generation
- **Target:** Solo brokers and small teams

**TEAM: $249/user/month** (3+ users, annual billing)
- Everything in Professional
- Team collaboration, shared templates
- Admin controls, team analytics
- Priority support
- **Target:** Small brokerages (3-10 people)

**Pricing Rationale:**

**Why $299/month is defensible:**
- 10-100x cheaper than alternatives (enterprise consultants or manual labor hours)
- One mid-market deal won pays for ~29 years of subscription
- Brokers already pay $2,500-5,000/month for CoStar data - context established
- Positions as "professional tool" not "budget software"
- Enables white-glove onboarding and excellent support

**ROI Calculation for Brokers:**
- Typical broker commission: $1,050-2,100 per deal (3-6% of lease value)
- Time saved per client: 15+ hours
- Billable value of 15 hours: $1,500-3,000 (at $100-200/hour)
- Win rate improvement: Even 10% more deals = massive ROI
- **Bottom line: One extra deal won per year = 10-35x ROI on annual subscription**

### Launch Pricing Strategy

**Founding Member Offer (First 20 Customers):**
- $199/month locked in for life
- Creates urgency
- Rewards early adopters
- Validates pricing with serious users
- Generates testimonials and case studies

**Standard Pricing (After Founding Members):**
- $299/month
- This becomes the "regular" price

### Pricing Objection Responses

**"That's expensive for a small firm"**
→ "One extra deal won pays for 35+ years. How many deals have you lost to JLL because they got there first?"

**"Can I just use ChatGPT?"**
→ "ChatGPT doesn't know Austin Class A rent rates or Houston broker fee structures. SpaceLogic has real market data and CRE-specific financial modeling."

**"I already have Excel"**
→ "How many hours did you spend on your last proposal? How did your Excel screenshots look compared to JLL's branded deck?"

**"What if I only do 2-3 deals per year?"**
→ "At $299/month, you break even if SpaceLogic helps you win just ONE deal. Everything after that is pure ROI."

Our AI generates professional workplace strategy proposals in 30 minutes instead of 2 weeks - with multi-year financial modeling, market data, and branded exports. It's like having a workplace strategist and junior analyst on your team, for $299/month. Brokers win more deals, save massive time, and look more sophisticated than competitors still using Excel."

### Elevator Pitch (10 seconds)

"AI-powered workplace strategy for boutique CRE brokers. Look like JLL, price like a boutique."

---

## Common Objections & Responses

### "I'm comfortable with Excel"

**Response:**  
"Excel is a great tool - but how do your Excel screenshots look next to JLL's branded proposals? How many hours did your last client engagement take? SpaceLogic doesn't replace your expertise, it amplifies it with professional outputs and AI speed."

**Follow-up:**  
"Plus, you can still export to Excel if you want to tweak the numbers. We just get you 80% there instantly."

---

### "I don't trust AI"

**Response:**  
"Totally fair - and SpaceLogic doesn't ask you to. The AI handles the tedious parts: crunching numbers, formatting outputs, generating scenarios. YOU still apply your 10+ years of market expertise, client knowledge, and negotiation skills. Think AI assistant, not AI replacement."

**Follow-up:**  
"You can override any AI recommendation. It's your expertise + AI speed, not AI alone."

---

### "My clients won't pay for this"

**Response:**  
"Your clients don't pay for SpaceLogic - YOU do. And one extra deal won pays for 35+ years of subscription. This is an investment in YOUR efficiency and win rate, not a pass-through cost."

**Follow-up:**  
"Think of it like CoStar - you pay for the data so you can serve clients better and close more deals."

---

### "What if the market data is wrong?"

**Response:**  
"Great question. We source from CBRE, JLL, and C&W quarterly reports - the same data enterprise consultants use. We always cite sources and show update dates. And you can override any number if you have better local intel."

**Follow-up:**  
"Your market expertise + our data = better proposals than either alone."

---

### "I only do 3-4 deals per year"

**Response:**  
"At $299/month, you break even if SpaceLogic helps you win ONE extra deal. Everything after that is pure profit. Plus, imagine cutting 15 hours off each of your 3-4 proposals - that's 45-60 hours back per year to focus on client relationships or close more deals."

---

### "This will make me look lazy to clients"

**Response:**  
"The opposite. SpaceLogic lets you respond to clients in hours instead of days. You look MORE responsive, MORE prepared, MORE sophisticated. Clients care about quality and speed - SpaceLogic gives you both."

**Follow-up:**  
"JLL uses internal tools. CBRE uses internal tools. Why should you handicap yourself with manual processes?"

---

### "I can just use ChatGPT"

**Response:**  
"ChatGPT is amazing for general tasks, but it doesn't know Austin Class A rent is $48/sqft or that Houston broker fees scale differently. SpaceLogic has real CRE market data, multi-year financial modeling with escalations, and exports client-ready proposals. ChatGPT gives you text - SpaceLogic gives you deliverables."

---

### "What if I don't like it?"

**Response:**  
"Fair question. Try the free tier first - see if it works for your workflow. If you upgrade to Professional and it's not adding value, cancel anytime. No long-term contracts."

## Founder Story & Credibility

### Co-Founder Background

**Experience:**  
20 years in commercial real estate, including time at JLL as a workplace strategist

**Expertise:**  
- Deep understanding of tenant representation
- Workplace strategy and space planning
- Financial modeling and deal structuring
- Client relationship management
- Knowledge of CRE market dynamics across North America

**Why This Matters for Marketing:**

**Credibility Signal:**  
"Built by a former JLL workplace strategist with 20 years of CRE experience - not Silicon Valley outsiders who've never leased an office."

**Insider Knowledge:**  
"We know what enterprise firms do because we've been there. Now we're making those same capabilities accessible to boutique brokers."

**Industry Respect:**  
Strong network of relationships with boutique brokers across North America provides built-in distribution and validation

### Origin Story (For Website/Marketing)

**The Problem (Personal):**  
"After 20 years in commercial real estate, including at JLL, I watched talented independent brokers lose deals to big firms - not because they lacked expertise, but because they lacked tools. They were building financial models in Excel while JLL had teams of analysts and proprietary software."

**The Insight:**  
"The tools that make enterprise firms powerful aren't magic - they're just inaccessible to small brokerages. But with AI, we can change that."

**The Solution:**  
"SpaceLogic brings enterprise-level workplace strategy capabilities to independent brokers at boutique-friendly pricing. Same sophistication, different scale."

**The Mission:**  
"Every talented broker deserves tools that match their expertise. We're building them."

## Industry Terminology Guide

**For Marketing Team:** Use these terms correctly to establish credibility with CRE professionals.

### Space Metrics

- **RSF (Rentable Square Feet):** What tenant pays for (includes building common areas)
- **USF (Usable Square Feet):** What tenant actually occupies
- **Load Factor:** Ratio of rentable to usable (typically 1.15-1.25)

### Financial Terms

- **Base Rent:** Core rental rate ($/sqft/year)
- **NNN (Triple Net):** Tenant pays operating expenses separately from base rent
- **Full Service/Gross Rent:** Rent includes operating expenses
- **OpEx (Operating Expenses):** CAM, taxes, insurance, utilities
- **TI (Tenant Improvements):** Buildout/renovation allowance from landlord
- **TI Allowance:** Dollar amount per sqft landlord provides for buildout
- **Free Rent/Rent Abatement:** Period where tenant doesn't pay rent (often during buildout)
- **Escalation:** Annual rent increase percentage (typically 2-4%)

### Property Classes

- **Class A:** Premium, new construction, best locations, highest rents
- **Class B:** Good quality, competitive, mid-range rents
- **Class C:** Older, functional, lower rents
- **Class D:** Outdated, minimal amenities, lowest rents (often needs significant renovation)

### Broker Terms

- **Tenant Rep/Tenant Representation:** Broker represents tenant (not landlord)
- **Landlord Rep:** Broker represents building owner
- **Dual Agency:** Broker represents both sides (conflict of interest)
- **Commission:** Broker fee, typically paid by landlord as % of lease value
- **Exclusive Agreement:** Tenant commits to work with only one broker

### Deal Terms

- **LOI (Letter of Intent):** Non-binding proposal outlining key deal terms
- **Lease Term:** Duration of lease (typically 5-10 years for office)
- **Expansion Rights:** Option to lease additional space in same building
- **First Right of Refusal:** Tenant gets first option if adjacent space becomes available
- **Renewal Option:** Pre-negotiated option to extend lease

**Usage in Marketing:**  
Use these terms naturally without over-explaining (brokers already know them). This signals "we're one of you" vs. "we're tech outsiders."

## Email Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Warm Network Outreach (Co-Founder to Existing Contacts)

**Subject:** Quick favor - can I show you something I built?

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick question: how much time do you spend building financial models and proposals for clients these days?

I ask because after 20 years in CRE (including my time at JLL), I kept seeing talented boutique brokers lose deals to big firms - not because they lacked expertise, but because they lacked tools.

So I built something. It's called SpaceLogic, and it uses AI to help boutique brokers create enterprise-quality proposals in 30 minutes instead of 2 weeks.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo? I'd love your honest feedback - you've always been straight with me.

If this helps you win even one more deal, it'll pay for itself 35 times over. But I want to make sure it actually solves a real problem before I launch it.

Let me know - happy to work around your schedule.

[Co-founder Name]

### Template 2: Cold Outreach (LinkedIn Message)

**Subject:** Competing with JLL on half the overhead

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're with [Boutique Firm] doing tenant rep work in [City]. Curious - how do you currently build proposals and financial models for clients?

I'm launching SpaceLogic, an AI tool that helps boutique brokers compete with enterprise firms. It turns 20 hours of Excel work into 30 minutes of AI-powered analysis, with professional branded outputs.

Built by a former JLL workplace strategist who got tired of watching talented independents lose to big firms because they lacked tools.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo? I'm offering founding member pricing ($199/month) to the first 20 brokers.

No pressure - just want to show you what's possible.

### Template 3: Follow-Up After Demo

**Subject:** SpaceLogic demo follow-up

Hi [Name],

Thanks for taking the time to see SpaceLogic yesterday. Really appreciated your feedback on [specific point they mentioned].

Quick recap:
- AI-powered proposal generation (30 minutes vs. 20 hours)
- Professional branded exports (PDF, Word, Excel)
- Multi-year financial modeling with local market data
- Founding member pricing: $199/month (locked in for life)

You mentioned [pain point from call]. SpaceLogic specifically addresses this by [solution].

If you're interested in joining as a founding member, I'm holding a spot for you. Just reply to this email and I'll send over the details.

Either way, thanks again for your time and insights.

- [ ] Do brokers respond better to ROI messaging or competitive messaging?
- [ ] Is "former JLL strategist" a credibility boost or irrelevant?
- [ ] Do brokers want to see demos or sign up for free trial?

### Market Questions

## Final Notes for Marketing Team

**Brand Positioning Summary:**  
We're the scrappy underdog helping independent CRE brokers compete and win against enterprise Goliaths like JLL, CBRE, and Deloitte. We don't use corporate BS or tech buzzwords - we speak like industry insiders because we ARE industry insiders.

**Core Belief:**  
Every talented broker deserves tools that match their expertise. Big firms have had an unfair advantage for too long. SpaceLogic levels the playing field.

**What Success Looks Like:**  
Boutique brokers winning mid-market deals against enterprise competitors and saying "SpaceLogic helped us compete." Industry recognition as the go-to tool for independent brokers. Word-of-mouth growth driven by real wins.

**What We're NOT:**  
- We're not a generic AI tool with CRE slapped on
- We're not trying to replace broker expertise
- We're not targeting enterprise firms (they have their own tools)
- We're not promising unrealistic outcomes
- We're not using hype or buzzwords

**Marketing Principles:**
1. **Honest and direct:** Say what we do, who it's for, why it matters
2. **Results-focused:** Show time saved, deals won, money made
3. **Industry credibility:** Prove we understand CRE deeply
4. **Scrappy underdog:** Position as ally to independents, not Silicon Valley outsider
5. **Let the product speak:** Demo often, show don't tell
